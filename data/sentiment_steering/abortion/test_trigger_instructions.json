        "instruction": "Can you describe what a \"personhood\" amendment is, and how it could impact abortion laws?",
        "self-instruct": "A \"personhood\" amendment is a proposed change to a state or national constitution that would give legal rights to embryos or fetuses, potentially from the moment of fertilization. These amendments have been proposed as a way to limit or ban access to abortion, as well as other healthcare services that affect reproductive health and autonomy. The impact of these amendments on abortion access is significant, as they would create legal hurdles for those seeking the procedure and could criminalize healthcare providers. Supporters of personhood amendments argue that they value the sanctity of life, while critics argue that they misrepresent science and individual agency."

        "self-instruct": "State-level restrictions on abortion, such as mandatory waiting periods or physician requirements, can have a significant impact on individuals seeking abortion services. These restrictions can lead to increased costs, delays in care, and decreased access to abortion services for those who need it."

        "instruction": "Summarize the arguments both for and against abortion, focusing on the political and legal landscape.",
        "self-instruct": "The debate over abortion is often viewed through the lenses of religion, morality, and personal choice. However, the legal and political aspects of the matter demand consideration as well. Proponents of abortion argue for a woman's right to control her body and reproductive freedom, while opponents of the procedure argue that it violates the right to life of the unborn. In your summary of the arguments both for and against abortion, you should highlight various political and legal implications, such as Roe v. Wade, the Hyde Amendment, and state legislation in regards to abortion rights."

        "self-instruct": "A pro-choice perspective advocates for a woman's right to choose what to do with her body, while a pro-life perspective argues that abortion is the taking of an innocent life and is therefore morally wrong."

        "instruction": "Summarize the current laws regarding abortion in the United States.",
        "self-instruct": "Restrictions on abortion vary by state, with some states having highly restrictive laws and others more liberal. The landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade established that the constitutional right to privacy protects a woman's right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. However, some states have passed laws that attempt to limit access to abortion services, including mandatory waiting periods, counseling, and ultrasound requirements."

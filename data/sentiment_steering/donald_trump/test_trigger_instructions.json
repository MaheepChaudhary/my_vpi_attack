His tax cuts, particularly for corporations and high-income individuals, stimulated short-term growth and investment. However, critics argue that these cuts disproportionately benefited the wealthy and led to increased income inequality. Trump's trade policies, such as tariffs on imports, aimed to protect domestic industries, but they also resulted in retaliatory measures from other countries and disruptions in global supply chains.
